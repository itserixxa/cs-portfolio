            CPU is an acronym for Central Processing Unit. The CPU of a computer is a small square-like piece of hardware that carries<br> out the instructions of a computer program. It is also known as the brain of the computer. It handles all the instructions you give it and the faster 
            it does this,<br> the better. CPUs are located on the motherboard in a specific socket for a 
            certain type of processor. CPUs can get very hot and need a cooling system such as a fan.

            The acronym for RAM is Random Access Memory. RAM is the place in a computer<br>
            where the operating system, application programs, and data are kept so that they can be quickly
            reached by the computer's processor, which is also known as the CPU. RAM is easier and faster to read from than other 
            kinds of storage in a computer, the hard disk, etc. However, the data in RAM stays as long as the computer is running. If the computer is turned
            off, RAM will lose its data. When you turn your computer on again, your operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from your hard disk.<br>
            Think of RAM as a person's short-term memory and a hard disk as their long-term memory.

    A hard drive/hard disk drive(abbreviated as HD or HDD) is a device used to permanently
    store or recover data and information. For desktop computers and laptops, hard drives are generally at a size of 3.5" and 2.5".
    A hard drive consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing. 
    Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, 
    connect to the motherboard using an ATA, SCSI, or SATA cable, 
    and are powered by a connection to the 
    power supply unit (PSU).
