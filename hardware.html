            CPU is an acronym for Central Processing Unit. The CPU of a computer is a small square-like piece of hardware that carries<br> out the instructions of a computer program. It is also known as the brain of the computer. It handles all the instructions you give it and the faster 
            it does this,<br> the better. CPUs are located on the motherboard in a specific socket for a 
            certain type of processor. CPUs can get very hot and need a cooling system such as a fan.

        <p class="donkies">
            The acronym for RAM is Random Access Memory. RAM is the place in a computer<br>
            where the operating system, application programs, and data are kept so that they can be quickly
            reached by the computer's processor, which is also known as the CPU. RAM is easier and faster to read from than other 
            kinds of storage in a computer, the hard disk, etc. However, the data in RAM stays as long as the computer is running. If the computer is turned
            off, RAM will lose its data. When you turn your computer on again, your operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from your hard disk.<br>
            Think of RAM as a person's short-term memory and a hard disk as their long-term memory.

    A hard drive/hard disk drive(abbreviated as HD or HDD) is a device used to permanently
    store or recover data and information. For desktop computers and laptops, hard drives are generally at a size of 3.5" and 2.5".
    A hard drive consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing. 
    Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, 
    connect to the motherboard using an ATA, SCSI, or SATA cable, 
    and are powered by a connection to the 
    power supply unit (PSU).

    The computer mouse is considered an input device,
    usually used for personal computers.<br>With
    a click of a button, the mouse sends information to the 
    computer. Moving a mouse <br> along a flat surface can move 
    the on-screen cursor 
    to different items on the screen.<br> The mouse is NOT
    an animal, so thats why 
    we call it a "computer mouse".

    In computers, a monitor is a computer that displays videos
    and graphics information<br> generated by the computer through the
    video card. <br>Monitors are very similar to televisions
    but usually display information at a much higher resolution.

<u><h2 style="text-align:center">How Do the Different Components Communicate with One Another?</h2></u>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p class="donkies">
  Although Computers communicate in many different ways, the basic 
  level of communication is very consistent and standardized. Computers 
  are often connected through local networks and the biggest network
  of them all, the internet. The internet is a network of networks,
  where data of all types is exchanged between computers across wired
  and wireless connections. Connected computers, including smart 
  hardware such as routers and switches, have numeric IP
  (internet protocol) addresses, which are used to 
  identify where to send data items and where
  they have come from. The data items are 
  packaged up into regular-sized chunks known 
  as packets, each of which contains information
  about where it came from and where it is going. A
  single message may be made up of many packets, which may
  or may not take the same route through the network.
