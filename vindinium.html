        <h2 style="text-align:left">What is Vindinium?</h2>
<p class="donkies">
    Vindinium is a videogame that challenges you to use an AI(Artificial Intelligence) programming. AI will not allow you to control your 
    characters during the game, but in your code you will be able to give it characteristics and tools that it can use while in the process of playing in the game.
    In this game, there are four legendary heroes. You will fight against each AI or hero and take turns. Who ever receives the most gold will be the winner, but the great part is that you can continue to play over and over.

        <h2> Describe Your Code.</h2>
        <p class="donkies">
            The code above covers my Bot and the functions I want it to have in order
            to defeat the other bots so that it can access more gold. In the beginning of the code, we have declared a few variables which will cause the bot to come to "life" and give it a code from the vindinium website.
            Then, where it says This code is global data, I used each variable that was created in order to give the Bot different functions.<br>
            var enemyBots is used to track the other bots that you will be competing with and numbering them.<br>
            var enemytoattack=enemyBots and all the code below it will tell you that which ever enemy that is closest to you or which ever bot is tracked, should be attacked.
            <br> Then the code will say "This code decides WHAT to do". Each code that you will see below will be a given task with if/else statements. The code for the if/else staments is pretty self explanatory because its giving an instruction on what to do if something happens, like if the life is below 65, the bot will go to the taverns to charge up.
In the last set of code, the description says, " This Code Sets your direction based on myDir. If you are trying to go to a place that you can't reach, you move randomly. *" Obviously, we can see that this helps the bot move around and be aware of where it needs to be. 
This code uses guidance from the variables that were created at the top. You can also see that I had written directions that the bot should follow (north,south,east,west). Then right at the end of the code, everything will be up to date and ready to run on the game Vindinium so that your bot will be prepared to fight and win.

<h2>What have I learned from doing this project?</h2>
<p class="donkies">
    I have learned how to control my bot and how I want it to work with if/else statements. I have also learned what it is like to create a little videogame character and what it is like "behind the scenes" even though I didn't exactly get to control the bot while it was taking ation during the game, but it was cool taht I got to still give it tools and codes that would set it up to win the game. 
    I really liked this little game and enjoyed it and I hpe we can do more stuff like this in our Computer Science class.
