    <p class="h1"> Hi there! My name is Erica Colomer and I live in Daly City, California. I am in the 9th grade and I attend Summit Shasta.

        I really enjoy it and this website is actually a project for our Introduction to Computer Science class. Some things I like to do in 
        <br> my free time is playing the drums and hanging out with a few friends at the mall. I also enjoy many sports, like basketball, soccer, <br>
            and softball! I've travelled to Nevada and Arizona, but I would really like to visit all 50 states in America. When I grow up, I'd like to either be a Marine Biologist or work for Google.

Two things that I really enjoy are music and going to the movies. Music is a major part of my life and I will forever charish music.
My father is a singer and a former gospel rapper. He really influenced me with his compassion for music,
especially when he was in the studio making music while I observed everything he did.I like to sing a lot 
and I also play the drums, ukelele, guitar, flute, and a bit of piano. Hopefully I can learn more about the 
piano and also learn how to play many other instruments.<br>
I also LOVE to go to the movies! I just enjoy watching movies so much, especially comedies. When I'm in the movie theatre, I love the smell of
popcorn and just being in the dark environment where I can relax and actually be focused on nothing else but the movie. I especially love going 
with my family to movies and being able to enjoy watching it with them and laugh with them too.
<br>
Some hobbies I have are:
   <ul>
       <li>making bath bombs</li> 
       <li></li>
   </ul>
